In this project, we will analyze the database of a Health Insurance company.

For any emergency, we know the importance of being insured by a service of this type, and how this can avoid unimaginable costs in specific cases.

- However, how can a company determine costs involved in providing this service?

- Which factors from your customers should have the most impact on this value?

- How, in an automated way, can we create a Machine Learning model to help us with this issue?


With this database, we will analyze answers to these questions and more, through a thorough exploratory analysis, knowledge of the PyCaret Python library, and graphical visualizations of the information.

We will also define the correlation between the variables and finally, the value prediction model and real examples that it can demonstrate.
